# Security Fixes for TPO Website

## Chrome Security Warning Resolution

This guide explains how to fix the Chrome "Dangerous site" warning that was appearing on your TPO website.

## What Was Causing the Issue?

1. **Overly Restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP)**
2. **Strict X-Frame-Options header**
3. **Missing HTTPS configuration**
4. **Incorrect security headers**

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Security Headers (`backend/server.js`)
- Changed `X-Frame-Options` from `DENY` to `SAMEORIGIN`
- Relaxed Content Security Policy to allow necessary resources
- Added proper HTTPS security headers

### 2. Created Security Configuration (`backend/security-config.js`)
- Centralized security settings
- Balanced security without being too restrictive
- Proper CORS configuration

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)
- Added security headers for development server
- Configured proper CORS settings
- Added HTTPS support options

## Security Headers Applied

```javascript
// Basic Security
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

// Content Security Policy (Balanced)
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data: blob:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data: blob:; img-src 'self' data: blob: https: http:; font-src 'self' data: blob: https:; connect-src 'self' https: http: ws: wss:; media-src 'self' data: blob: https:; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self';

// Additional Security
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your deployment:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear Chrome's cache and cookies
2. **Test Registration**: Try accessing the registration page
3. **Check Console**: Look for any remaining security warnings
4. **Verify Emails**: Ensure resume attachments are working

## Security Benefits

✅ **No More Chrome Warnings**: Website accessible to all users
✅ **Balanced Security**: Secure without being overly restrictive
✅ **Proper CORS**: Cross-origin requests handled correctly
✅ **HTTPS Ready**: Prepared for SSL deployment
✅ **File Uploads**: Resume attachments working in emails

## Monitoring

- Check server logs for security header application
- Monitor CORS requests in browser console
- Verify email functionality with resume attachments
- Test on different browsers and devices

## Support

If you still see security warnings:
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Verify all security headers are being applied
3. Ensure HTTPS is properly configured
4. Test with different browsers

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated code**
2. **Test the registration system**
3. **Verify email functionality**
4. **Monitor for any remaining issues**

Your TPO website should now be accessible to everyone without Chrome security warnings!
